## Test Strategy

In the interview exam, I implemented the test scenarios directly within the E2E test file, ensuring all acceptance criteria were covered for each scenario. The LoginTest file provides an example of functional testing for the specific features.

Test Scenario: As a user, I want to log in to https://www.saucedemo.com/ with valid user’s credential and add the product to the shopping cart.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Validate that you’re logged in successfully. /
- Sorting the price from high to low. /
- Validate that the product was added into the cart. /
- Log the checkout summary. /

**Test result:**
